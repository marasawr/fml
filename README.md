I read 20 years of mostly-fail at cyber norms at the UN, and now you can too!
## How to use this repository
### Organisation & naming conventions

 • Files have been renamed to reflect UN document IDs rather than job numbers (which are useless); slashes and full stops are omitted
      
     – e.g., A/RES/53/70 == ARES5370.pdf; A/C.1/70/PV.21 == AC170PV21.pdf; A/61/161 == A61161.pdf
      
 • Highlights and markups are mine; don't trust or plagiarise them
 
 • Alternate and/or original language translations available via document ID in the [UN ODS](https://documents.un.org)
     
### Symbols
  
      – A/ indicates a document of the General Assembly 
      
      – A/RES/##/### & ARES##### indicate a resolution 
      
      – A/C.1/##/### & AC1##### indicate a document of the First Committee 
      
      – A/C.1/##/PV.### & AC1##PV### indicate a verbatim record (procès-verbaux) of the First Committee 
      
      – A/##/### & A##### indicate reports of the Secretary-General (e.g., replies received from governments) 
      
      – A/##/###/Add.# & A#####ADD# indicate an addendum 
      
      – A/##/###/Corr.# & A#####CORR# indicate a corrigendum 
      
      – A/##/###/Rev.# & A#####REV# indicate a revision replacing texts previously issued 

      
### Note on the PV indices

   • These catalogue procès-verbaux only
      
   • Earlier indices often confused 'information' agenda items in the First Committee. In the 53rd Session ICT security was introduced under the rubric of 'science and technology,' then in the 54th Session listed under 'information – international security.' Confusion persisted for ... a while
   
   • The PV indices do not accurately reflect which states spoke to the issue of information and telecommunications in the context of international security; markups of the indices reflect manual review of verbatim records

### Good places to start

• Obvs chronological order, i.e., with [A/C.1/53/3](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session53/AC1533.pdf) and [A/C.1/53/L.17](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session53/AC153L17.pdf)
  
• Unless you want cross-battles between Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, in which case, head to [A/C.1/70/PV.21](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session70/AC170PV21.pdf)

• Or unless you want the manual for Russian influence and information operations, in which case head to [A/54/213](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session54/A54213.pdf), [A/55/140](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session55/A55140.pdf), and [A/56/164/Add.1](https://github.com/marasawr/fml/blob/f61f787a119c25c584f73f3e9884e03ca50b5818/session56/A56164ADD1.pdf) ... for a start
